    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>For the third year running, Ragdoll cats have taken the top spot as America’s most popular cat breed. Why? Well just look at that fluffy, long-haired coat, those milky-blue eyes and pointed color patterns! You might be wondering where these cuties got their name – well they go pretty limp when picked up, so along with always being keen for a cwtch (look it up, it’s our new favorite word), their placid and docile disposition makes them all too easy to love.
